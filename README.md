# go-ebiten-camera-demo

A detailed explanation on how to implement a 2d camera using the ebitenengine in go

The camera should support the following 
- zoom
- rotation
- position

This explains the a standard [ebitengine](https://ebitengine.org) game. 

You have your game struct in [game/game.go](game/game.go) satisfying the [ebiten.Game interface](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten/v2#Game) and hand it over to the ebitengine in [main.go](main.go). VoilÃ¡, you have yourself a game :smile:

## A word of translation

Ebitengine uses a left-handed coordinate system. That is that the origin (0,0) is in the upper-left corner. When you place an image on the screen, the image's origin, also the upper-left corner, is placed at the coordinate (0,0).

To move an image you use the `ebiten.DrawImageOptions{}` GeoM.Translate() method. With passing new x,y coordinates to the method ebitengine moves the origin of the image to the provided coordinate. If you know vector math, this is the equivalent of adding a vector to another one.

## decoupling the screen from the world

> git checkout ead24633a6828e9e1d2518f48cd9ecf30bf9fbf6

Usually the world, in which your game objects reside is larger than the actual screen's dimensions. Therfore we introduced a world variable of type `*ebiten.Image` that is now the rendering destination of our two game objects (background and player). 

Observe that after drawing the objects into the world, we draw the world into the screen using the `screen.Draw()` method with an no DrawImageOptions specified. 

The result is not very spectacular - we render the same image.
